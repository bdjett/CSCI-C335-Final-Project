#CSCI-C335 Final Project

Final Project for IU CSCI-C335 (Computer Structures)

##Course Description

This course focused on how programs written in high level languages are evaluated by a processor. The code was written for and run on the STM32 (ARM Cortex-M4) processor. Focus was on embedded system programming with common protocols such as async serial, SPI and I2C, interrupts, UART, and DMA.

##Project Description

Develop a video game that incorporates the concepts and devices learned in the course. This game should incorporate the following devices:

* LCD
* Audio
* User Input (1 or more device)
* Button
* Nunchuk
* Board Accel, Gyro, or Mag
* SD Card
